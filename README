Hey, this is where I will be adding a bunch of projects that I have worked on in the past as well as ones that I am currently working on.

IMPORTANT:

Turing requires windows to run, if you are using a Mac, make sure to run a virtual system.

To play my Turing game, you must use the “turing.exe” found within the Turing4.1.1 folder.
Make sure to open the turing file found in “Shen’s_Space_Game_2012” and to run the program!

Have fun!
