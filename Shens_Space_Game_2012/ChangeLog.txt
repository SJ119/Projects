-Implemented adaptive fuel (as you progress in the game, the amount of gas given for each fuel collected is also increased)
	-Thinking of increasing actual amount of fuel with a floor(ln()) function rather than increasing the value of fuel.
-Polished up spaceshipboss, and spaceshipminiboss behaviour (smoother transitions)
-Made background stars more realistic, adds sense of depth
-Fixed menuscreen vs continuescreen bug
-Minor performance improvements
